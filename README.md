*Because right now I'm favouring the Atomic Design naming approach, apparently*

## Purpose
I got tired of porting and gisting all the various snippets and chunklets of code from project to project (and employer to employer). This is my attempt at consolidating and making sense of my own methodology that's highly influenced by others.

It's intended purpose is as a started and toolkit for your own projects. You can include it as a base for your own projects, or build within it.


## Methodologies employed
I dont believe any single methodology or approach will ever be all encompassing and without pitfalls. I also don't believe that any methodology should be so rigid that it prevents incorporating that which is valuable from another approach.

- BEM
- OOCSS
- Hungarian Notation

## In the box:
A reset, normalize, a devmode flag for some extra niceties (WIP), a pair-object, grid system, blocking system, a buncha mixins, a speculative CSS structure

## Where it is
Realistically it's about 50% complete. There are more things I'd like to add to it, but for the most part it has the basic tools I require.

## Where I want it to be
I have plans to build out a pattern library of components and objects. Also it needs documentation.
