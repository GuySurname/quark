*Because right now I'm favouring the Atomic Design naming approach, apparently*

## Purpose
I got tired of porting and gisting all the various snippets and chunklets of code from project to project (and employer to employer). This is my attempt at consolidating and making sense of my own methodology that's highly influenced by others. I'm 6'4" and *still* attempting to stand on the shoulders of giants.

It's currently more of a project boilerplate than a toolkit you would plug into your own project (though you can easily do that). There are some folder structures in place for things that are not objects or may not be used in your project.


## Methodologies employed
I dont believe any single methodology or approach will ever be all encompassing and without pitfalls. I also don't believe that any methodology should be so rigid that it prevents incorporating that which is valuable from another approach.

- BEM
- OOCSS
- <s>Hungarian Notation</s> (Don't know if I'm feeling this anymore. It's great for code transparency, but it hurts my hands)
- ITCSS

## In the box:
A reset, normalize, a devmode flag for some extra niceties (WIP), a pair-object, grid system, blocking system, a buncha mixins, a speculative CSS structure

## Where it is
Realistically it's about 50% complete. There are more things I'd like to add to it, but for the most part it has the basic tools I require. I don't want to bloat it.

## Where I want it to be
I'd like to get some examples setup, a library of components and plugins. I'd like to document it properly so that the outside user can pick it up.
