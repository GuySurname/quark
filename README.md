# Quark
*Because right now I'm favouring the Atomic Design naming approach, apparently*

## Purpose
I got tired of porting and gisting all the various snippets and chunklets of code from project to project (and employer to employer). This is my attempt at consolidating and making sense of my own methodology that's highly influenced by others. I'm 6'4" and *still* attempting to stand on the shoulders of giants.


## Methodologies employed
I dont believe any single methodology or approach will ever be all encompassing and without pitfalls. I also don't believe that any methodology should be so rigid that it prevents incorporating that which is valuable from another approach.

- BEM
- OOCSS
- <s>Hungarian Notation</s> (Don't know if I'm feeling this anymore. It's just extra keystrokes, though I like the transparency it give me)
- ITCSS
